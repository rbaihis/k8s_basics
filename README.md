# Kubernetes Resources Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the key Kubernetes resources used in production environments, along with their primary purposes.

## 1. Pods
The basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes, pods are used to run one or more containers. Each pod shares the same network namespace, allowing containers to communicate easily.

## 2. Deployments
Deployments manage the deployment of stateless applications. They ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running and allow for easy updates and rollbacks of application versions.

## 3. ReplicaSets
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. While commonly created by Deployments, they can also be used independently to maintain high availability.

## 4. StatefulSets
StatefulSets are designed for managing stateful applications, such as databases. They provide stable network identities and persistent storage for each pod, ensuring that data is not lost during restarts.

## 5. DaemonSets
A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod runs on all (or specific) nodes in the cluster. This is useful for deploying system-level services like monitoring agents or log collectors.

## 6. Services
Services provide stable networking and access to pods, enabling communication between different parts of an application. They abstract the underlying pods, allowing for seamless scaling and updates.

## 7. Ingress
Ingress manages external access to services, providing HTTP routing, SSL termination, and load balancing. It simplifies access to multiple services through a single external IP address.

## 8. ConfigMaps
ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data, such as application settings or environment variables. They allow for easy updates to configuration without modifying the container images.

## 9. Secrets
Secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, or SSH keys. They ensure secure handling of sensitive data and can be consumed by pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

## 10. PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
PersistentVolumes represent pieces of storage in the cluster that are provisioned by an administrator. PersistentVolumeClaims are requests for storage by users, allowing applications to use persistent storage.

## 11. Jobs
Jobs create one or more pods to run a specific task until completion. They ensure that the task succeeds and can be used for batch processing or one-time jobs.

## 12. CronJobs
CronJobs are similar to Jobs but run on a specified schedule, allowing for periodic tasks such as backups or report generation.

## 13. NetworkPolicies
NetworkPolicies define rules for communication between pods, allowing for fine-grained control of traffic flow. This enhances security by restricting which pods can communicate with each other.

## 14. Namespaces
Namespaces provide a way to partition resources within a cluster. They allow for multiple environments (e.g., development, testing, production) to coexist in the same cluster, improving resource management and organization.

## 15. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
CRDs allow users to extend Kubernetes by defining their own resource types. This enables the integration of custom logic and workflows into Kubernetes.
