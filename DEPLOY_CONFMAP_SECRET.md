## Kubernetes Secrets

### What is a Secret?

A **Secret** in Kubernetes is an object used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, and other confidential data. Secrets allow you to keep this sensitive information separate from application code and configuration files, enhancing security and simplifying management.

### Types of Secrets

Kubernetes Secrets can be of several types, including:
- **Opaque**: The default type that stores arbitrary user-defined data as key-value pairs.
- **Docker Registry**: Stores credentials for pulling images from private Docker registries.
- **Basic Authentication**: Stores basic authentication credentials.
- **SSH Authentication**: Stores SSH authentication credentials.
- **TLS**: Stores TLS certificates and private keys.

### Storage and Behavior

- **Storage**: Secrets are stored in etcd, the key-value store used by Kubernetes. By default, Secrets are stored as base64-encoded strings, which provides a basic level of obfuscation but not true encryption. To enhance security, you can enable encryption at rest for etcd.

- **Behavior**: When a Secret is created, it can be consumed by Pods as environment variables, mounted as files, or referenced in other Kubernetes resources. Access to Secrets is controlled by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to define which users or service accounts can view or modify Secrets.

## Kubernetes ConfigMaps

### What is a ConfigMap?

A **ConfigMap** in Kubernetes is an object used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs. ConfigMaps allow you to decouple environment-specific configurations from your application code, making it easier to manage and update configurations without redeploying your application.

### Storage and Behavior

- **Storage**: ConfigMaps are also stored in etcd as key-value pairs. Unlike Secrets, ConfigMaps do not provide built-in security features, so they should not be used to store sensitive information.

- **Behavior**: ConfigMaps can be consumed by Pods in various ways, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, or mounted as files in a volume. This flexibility allows applications to easily access configuration data and adapt to different environments.

### Summary

Both Secrets and ConfigMaps are essential tools for managing configuration and sensitive information in Kubernetes. While Secrets are designed to handle sensitive data with stricter access controls, ConfigMaps are intended for general configuration data. Proper use of these objects enhances the security and maintainability of your Kubernetes applications.

# Kubernetes Configuration for Spring Boot Application with PostgreSQL

This document outlines the Kubernetes configuration for a Spring Boot application that uses PostgreSQL. The configuration includes a Secret for the database password and a ConfigMap for other database connection parameters.

## 1. Secret for PostgreSQL Password

Create a Kubernetes Secret to store the PostgreSQL password.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: postgres-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: <base64_encoded_password>
```
> To create the base64 encoded password, use the following command:
> ```bash
> echo -n "your_password_here" | base64
> ```

## 2. ConfigMap for Database Configuration

Create a ConfigMap to store other PostgreSQL connection parameters.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: postgres-config
data:
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://your-postgres-db-host:5432/yourdb
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: your-db-username
```

## 3. Deployment for Spring Boot Application

Deploy the Spring Boot application, using the Secret and ConfigMap for environment variables.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: springboot-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: springboot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: springboot-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: springboot-container
        image: your-springboot-app-image
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: postgres-config
        - secretRef:
            name: postgres-secret
```

## Summary

This configuration provides a clean and organized way to manage sensitive information and application settings for a Spring Boot application using PostgreSQL in a Kubernetes environment.
